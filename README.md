# Co-Working Space Client

#### An exercise in doing freelance work for a client who owns a co-working space, using sketch to mockup a website for them.

#### By **Brea Borlas**

### Inspiration
A large inspiration for this project is The Wing, a social club for female professionals (not just tech workers). It includes spaces for working, socializing, making, and holding events. Their website has a somewhat retro vibe and the colors of the space are reflected in the website. It would fit the client's brief well to make their website a slightly less feminine version of The Wing's. Shown below are some other inspiration sources as well, including Urban Outfitters, Glossier, and Lonny.

This font combination and color palette feel unique and cool, but still approachable.

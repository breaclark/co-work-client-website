# Co-Working Space Client

#### An exercise in doing freelance work for a client who owns a co-working space, using sketch to mockup a website for them.

#### By **Brea Borlas**

### Inspiration
A large inspiration for this project is The Wing, a social club for female professionals (not just tech workers). It includes spaces for working, socializing, making, and holding events. Their website has a somewhat retro vibe and the colors of the space are reflected in the website. It would fit the client's brief well to make their website a slightly less feminine version of The Wing's. Shown below are some other inspiration sources as well, including Urban Outfitters, Glossier, and Lonny.

### Layout Inspiration

Wework, The Wing, and Centrl Office all have pretty similar layouts: a fixed navbar at the top including links for their spaces and such, the main logo on the left side of the navbar, a member login on the right side of the navbar, then some sort of photo (or gallery), with a banner stating their main purpose below. Somewhere near the photo there is a call to action to take a tour/sign up/ or login. Under that is some text and pictures detailing more about their space and purpose. This website should mirror that layout.

### Font and Color Palette Inspiration

This font combination and color palette feel unique and cool, but still approachable, in line with the brief the client has given.
